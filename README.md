# TopoPy
The main goal of TopoPy is to recreate TopoMap using Python while also implementing a different distance metric that will improve its running time. We are interested in comparing the performance of our project with TopoMap’s implementation using Euclidean distance, as well as incorporate the Manhattan Distance as a new metric to explore. The Manhattan distance metric determines the absolute difference among pairs of coordinates, whereas Euclidean distance computes the ordinary distance between two points. Our interest in TopoMap stems from wanting to learn how to implement a projection technique from scratch that focuses on preserving topological structures during the dimensionality reduction process. We’d like to modify TopoMap to use Manhattan distance due to its better performance than Euclidean distance in high dimensional applications.
